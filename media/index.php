        <h2>Cullen Commission Set to Hold May/June Hearings Via Videoconferencing</h2>
        <p><strong>Vancouver, B.C.</strong> – The Commission of Inquiry into Money Laundering in British Columbia has announced that it will proceed with its scheduled evidence hearings in May and June, beginning on May 25, 2020. In order to lessen the risk of the transmission of COVID-19, the public hearings will be held via online videoconferencing using Microsoft Teams.</p>
        <p>Over the past several weeks, the Commission team has run multiple mock hearings to test the process. The Commission’s staff and lawyers are confident in their ability to effectively hold the upcoming block of hearings by videoconference.</p>
        <p>Given the current situation throughout the country, with schools closed and the majority of Canadians working from home, the Commissioner has adjusted the hours of the May-June hearings. They will run from 9:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., Monday to Friday, with a break or two partway through the hearing time.</p>
        <p>Adjustments to the hearing plan have been made in response to the global pandemic and its impact on some participants and witnesses. At this time, it is expected that these hearings will take approximately three and a half weeks to complete. The bulk of the hearings will take place in early September, through the fall.</p>
        <p>This hearing block will deal with an overview of the money laundering topic and regulatory models. This approach in using digital technology has allowed the Commission team to replicate a traditional courtroom hearing as closely as possible. In keeping with the Commissioner’s commitment to transparency and accessibility, the hearings will be livestreamed on the website (<a href="http://www.cullencommission.ca">www.cullencommission.ca</a>). Reports, documents and exhibits from the hearings will likewise be posted online.</p>
        <p>The schedule of witnesses is now listed on the Commission’s website; it can be seen here: <a href="https://cullencommission.ca/schedule/">www.cullencommission.ca/schedule/</a> This schedule may be adjusted.</p>
        <p><strong>About the Commission</strong></p>
        <p>The Commission of Inquiry into Money Laundering in British Columbia was announced on May 15, 2019 by Premier John Horgan. It is independent of government. Led by Commissioner Austin Cullen, a judge of the British Columbia Supreme Court, the Commission will look at the full scope of money laundering in British Columbia, including real estate, gaming, financial institutions, and the corporate and professional sectors. The Commission will also examine regulatory authorities and barriers to effective law enforcement of money laundering activities. Commissioner Cullen has the ability to compel witnesses and order the production of documents and records.</p>
        <p>The Commission is required to deliver an interim report by November 15, 2020 and a final report by May 2021. For more information, please visit: <a href="http://www.cullencommission.ca">www.cullencommission.ca</a>.</p>

        <h2>Statement of Commissioner Austin Cullen<br />on the Impact of COVID-19</h2>
        <p>COVID-19, the insidious disease caused by the novel coronavirus, has caused unprecedented change in all of our lives. That change has occurred in a sudden and remarkable fashion as this deadly virus continues to besiege our world causing turmoil and grief. The virus, and the public health measures taken to slow its spread, have had an immense impact throughout the province of British Columbia.</p>
        <p>The purpose of this statement is to provide my update, as Commissioner, to the people of British Columbia about what COVID-19 means for the work of the Commission of Inquiry into Money Laundering.</p>
        <p>When this Commission was formed on May 15, 2019, money laundering was viewed as a serious threat to the social and economic well-being of British Columbians. Since that time, the Commission has undertaken significant steps towards fulfilling its mandate of casting light on the problem of money laundering in British Columbia and of examining the various ways in which it has been either combatted or enabled.</p>
        <p>Commission counsel have engaged with participants; interviewed many witnesses; engaged subject-matter experts to conduct research and analysis; sought the production of documents; and prepared for the hearings set to bring a broad array of information and evidence to the public’s attention. In the fall of 2019, we held public meetings in five locations around the province to hear directly from the people of British Columbia and earlier this year, we conducted initial public hearings during which the participants with standing gave opening submissions.</p>
        <p>Dealing with the issue of money laundering — which the people of British Columbia have told us is important — continues to be a priority. However, it is also crucial that we acknowledge that, at this moment in time, we place it in the context of the social, economic and physical upheavals brought by the devastating spread of the COVID-19 virus since early 2020. At this point it is impossible to predict when the effects of the COVID-19 virus will subside, and when our social, economic and physical health will return to a state of equilibrium. There is, however, no doubt that this will happen, and we will return to a more familiar state of affairs.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, the Commission continues with its work with such modifications and accommodations as are necessary to prioritize the health and safety of all involved, to comply with the recommendations of government and public health officials, and to be sensitive to the impact this virus is having on British Columbians. To that end, Commission lawyers and staff are working remotely from their homes. All contact with participants, lawyers, witnesses, experts, technicians and one another now takes place by telephone or videoconference. The Commission is in ongoing contact with those engaged with the Commission’s work, to ensure that their engagement does not put their health or well-being at risk.</p>
        <p>Understandably, some participants have been unable to fully carry on in the face of the current necessary restrictions, and other critical demands on their attention and time. The Commission will work to ensure that no one who has sought and been granted participant status will be compromised in their ability to engage with the Inquiry, and advance or guard their interests or rights. Similarly, the Commission will ensure that no steps will be taken that may imperil others’ rights or interests, unless and until that person or agency is able to engage with the Commission as a participant or otherwise. In short, the Commission is committed to ensuring that although its work will continue as much as possible through this unsettled and challenging period, no one will be prejudiced as a result.</p>
        <p>As matters currently stand, the hearings portion of the Inquiry is set in two blocks of time. The first is scheduled to start on May 25 and carry on until the end of June 2020. The second block of hearings will run from September 8 to December 18, 2020. We accept that it is not realistic or appropriate to conduct the initial May-June hearings with in-person attendance by witnesses, participants or their counsel or in a venue that is open to the public; those hearings will only proceed if we are able to conduct them remotely using videoconferencing technology able to link witnesses, participants, and Commission staff in a manner that sufficiently approximates a more conventional hearing and that provides access to the public. We are in the process of exploring options for proceeding with largely remote hearings. While our investigations of these technologies are ongoing, the initial indications are promising. It may also be necessary to modify the hours of sitting for the May-June hearing block to accommodate the needs of overseas witnesses (attending by video from abroad) and the childcare responsibilities of the participants and their lawyers as the hearings proceed.</p>
        <p>The primary focus of the May-June hearings will not be fact finding in relation to acts or omissions of individuals or agencies that may have contributed to money laundering in British Columbia. This hearing block will, instead, provide an introduction to and an exploration of larger issues of money laundering — such as a review of typologies of money laundering; its history and evolution; how it is perceived and dealt with in other jurisdictions; and the issue of quantification (attempts to measure the extent of money laundering activity).</p>
        <p>The Commission team is committed to moving forward in a responsible, safe and sensitive manner, always with a view to serving the public interest. We will continue to monitor developments and follow known health authority guidelines and to evaluate the propriety of our plans to conduct the initial May-June hearings remotely via video.</p>
        <p>Our hope and our plan are to continue with our work, to adapt to circumstances that have changed profoundly, and to make use of videoconferencing technology that makes possible today what would have been unachievable just a decade ago. As we move forward, we will provide updates on our plans and decisions through our website.</p>
        <p>My purpose in communicating with you at this time and in this way is to explain that although the Commission is continuing to fulfil its mandate through this very unsettled time, we are doing so in a manner that recognizes the overarching priority of the COVID-19 crisis and the need to fully support efforts to limit the spread of the virus. Our desire to proceed rests on the precept that in the fullness of time, the work we do now will benefit the social and economic well-being of the province.</p>

        <h2>Update Re: COVID-19 and May/June Hearing Block</h2>
        <p>The Commission of Inquiry into Money Laundering in British Columbia continues to closely monitor the rapidly developing situation regarding COVID-19. Our priority is the health and safety of all Canadians including, of course, the Commission team, participants and their lawyers, and other stakeholders.</p>
        <p>While the Commission’s physical office is closed to the public, the Commission has technology in place to allow us to continue to work towards fulfilling our mandate while supporting physical distancing. The Commission staff is working remotely, and all meetings are being held by video or telephone.</p>
        <p>We are in an unprecedented time. While none of us know how long we may be required to keep physical distancing measures in place, it does appear from recent statements by government and health officials that it will be some time before the measures will be appreciably relaxed. Recognizing that, holding in-person hearings that are open to the public is unlikely to be viable in May and June. As such, the Commission team is working on options for holding the hearing block set for May 25 – June 26, 2020 using video conference technology in a manner that will be accessible to interested parties and the public.</p>
        <p>We will provide updates about the format and viability of proceeding this way as we have them. Any decision regarding the hearings will, of course, be consistent with direction provided by provincial and federal health authorities.</p>
        <p>The May 25 – June 26 hearings will deal with an overview of the money laundering topic and regulatory models, as well as explore the issue of the quantification of money laundering activity in British Columbia.</p>
        <p>We will continue to work towards fulfilling our mandate, while at the same time complying with recommendations from both federal and provincial health authorities and prioritizing health and safety.</p>

        <h2>Commission of Inquiry into Money Laundering in British Columbia Public Meetings Commissioner Austin Cullen Opening Remarks</h2>
        <p>I would like to begin by welcoming you to this meeting and thanking you for attending. Your presence signals an interest in and a concern about the subject matter of this Inquiry. This event is part of a larger process, which will enable us to hear from various communities about the issues we are inquiring into.</p>
        <p>As you are aware, the Government of the Province of British Columbia established this Commission of Inquiry into Money Laundering in British Columbia on May 15, 2019. I have been appointed Commissioner.</p>
        <p>Present with me at this meeting—as I am sure you have noticed—are several members of the Commission team.</p>
        <p>Our Inquiry’s terms of reference are quite broad. Speaking generally, they require the Commission to study the prevalence of money laundering in, and its impact on, various economic sectors including gaming, horse racing, real estate, financial institutions and money service businesses, the corporate sector, luxury goods and professional services—including lawyers and accountants.</p>
        <p>The Commission is also mandated to review the acts and/or omissions of individuals and agencies responsible for combating money laundering, in order to determine whether those acts or omissions have contributed to the spread of money laundering and if so, whether they amount to corruption.</p>
        <p>In recent years, there has been extensive media investigation and coverage of money laundering. There have also been studies and reports prepared by academics and other experts that shed light on the prevalence of money laundering in the province and on its noticeable effects.</p>
        <p>As a result, the public has become aware of, and concerned about, this problem. One recent poll reported that approximately 90% of British Columbians are concerned about money laundering.</p>
        <p>It is part of this Inquiry’s role to add to the public’s understanding of the nature and scale of money laundering in the province and to address its concerns, to the extent possible, through recommendations for action.</p>
        <p>There is an incidental benefit from simply bringing additional concentrated attention to the crime of money laundering. The more awareness there is of its presence and of the profound social harms it propagates, the less complacency there can be for facilitating or tolerating it.</p>
        <p>Money laundering is a particularly insidious crime. Its roots are in offences that victimize others—often people who are vulnerable. In its actual commission, however, money laundering is akin to the transmission of a serious contagious disease. Both events may be inconspicuous, yet each invariably leads to an erosion of well-being.</p>
        <p>We will examine how money laundering is taking place in British Columbia. We will examine whether such transactions could be prevented with a better approach, better training, or a different legal or regulatory regime. We will look at whether lapses in judgment or honesty have compromised the prevention of money laundering and contributed to its growth. We will listen to proposed solutions to these problems and issues, and we will assess their effectiveness and compatibility with our constitutional imperatives. We will make recommendations to the government for their use.</p>
        <p>At this stage, the Commission is in the process of gathering information through the study of and follow-up on media reports; the review and analysis of other studies and reports; research into various legal and factual issues; the acquisition and review of documents held by agencies, individuals or corporate sources; and interviews of potential witnesses and experts. We are in a phase where much of the Commission’s work is happening out of the public spotlight, with lawyers, investigators and analysts drilling into the issues. All of this hard work will lead us to the evidence hearings, which will take place in 2020. We will make a point of providing detailed notice about all of this on our website as we carry on.</p>
        <p>Today’s public meeting and those we are holding around the province are part of that exploration and discovery process. We are not yet in a position to provide answers to questions. To attempt to do so would be premature and might amount to prejudging issues that have not been fully canvassed. We come to these meetings not to provide information, but to obtain it. Our responses to everything that we hear, see and read will be made at a later stage in the process: through an interim report to be issued in November of 2020 and a final report to be issued in May of 2021.</p>
        <p>It is our hope that these meetings will help raise awareness of the issues we are mandated to investigate, provide us with the nature and scale of public concern in different communities in the province, and help us to shape our approach and ultimate response to what has consistently been characterized as a serious problem requiring attention and action.</p>
        <p>I really appreciate that you have each taken the time to come here today to share your views about this problem. An engaged community is at the foundation of a well-functioning society. Your perspective and feedback about money laundering and how you feel that it is affecting your community is important to the work that we are doing at the Commission.</p>
        <p>I very much look forward to hearing from you.</p>
        <p>Thank you.</p>

        <h2>Speaking Notes – Commissioner Austin Cullen<br>Commission of Inquiry into Money Laundering in British Columbia</h2>
        <p>Before I formally open this hearing, I would like to say a few words since this is the first time that I am speaking publicly in my role as Commissioner of the Commission of Inquiry into Money Laundering in British Columbia.</p>
        <p>This hearing has been convened in accordance with a direction I made following the receipt of 20 applications from various individuals and entities seeking leave to participate in the Commission of Inquiry into Money Laundering in British Columbia. On September 24, 2019, I granted participant status to 16 of the applicants with a direction that the remaining four applicants—Messrs. Alderson, Desmarais, Lightbody and Pinnock—attend an oral hearing of the Inquiry to enable a further review and determination of their individual circumstances in light of the relevant considerations governing those applications.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, the British Columbia Real Estate Association sought—and was granted—an extension of time to apply for participant status. I granted the extension of time and their application for participant status on October 16, 2019. My reasons for doing so are posted on the commission’s website.</p>
        <p>As I understand it, Mr. Alderson, after discussions with Senior Commission Counsel, has elected to withdraw his application for participant status, being satisfied that if he is called as a witness, he will be able to contribute to the work of the Commission to the extent he wishes.</p>
        <p>Before considering the remaining three applications, it seems appropriate to provide a brief overview of the nature and scope of our mandate and to say something about the Commission itself, which will help to give some context to these applications.</p>
        <p>As I noted in the Introductory Statement posted on the Commission’s website, there appears to be a consensus among law enforcement officials, academics and subject matter experts that British Columbia is a jurisdiction in which money laundering is flourishing.</p>
        <p>The mandate of the Commission—which was established by the Provincial Government—is very broad. It encompasses various economic sectors where money laundering is said to have taken root, grown and evolved, and it requires the Commission to make findings of fact in relation to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The extent, growth, evolution and methods of money laundering in British Columbia, with regard to specific economic sectors;</li>
            <li>The acts or omissions of responsible regulatory agencies and individuals, and whether those have contributed to money laundering in the province or amount to corruption;</li>
            <li>The scope and effectiveness of the anti-money laundering powers, duties and functions of these regulatory agencies and individuals; and</li>
            <li>The barriers to effective law enforcement in relation to money laundering.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition, the Commission has a responsibility to make recommendations to address the conditions that have enabled money laundering to grow and evolve in the province.</p>
        <p>In recent years, there has been extensive media investigation and coverage of money laundering. There have also been studies and reports prepared by academics and other experts that shed light on the prevalence of money laundering in the province and on its noticeable effects.</p>
        <p>As a result, the public has become aware of, and concerned about, this problem. One recent poll reported that approximately 90% of British Columbians are concerned about money laundering.</p>
        <p>It is part of this Inquiry’s role to add to the public’s understanding of the nature and scale of money laundering in the province and to address its concerns, to the extent possible, through recommendations for action.</p>
        <p>There is also an incidental benefit from simply bringing additional concentrated attention to the crime of money laundering. The more awareness there is of its presence, and of the profound social harms it springs from and propagates, the less complacency there can be for facilitating or tolerating it.</p>
        <p>Brock Martland, Q.C. and Patrick McGowan, who are present at this hearing, are the two Senior Commission Counsel. They have undertaken the significant responsibility of assembling and organizing the evidence that will be placed before the Commission at the hearing stage. The evidence will come from many sources and will cover a broad array of topics. To assist in this task, they have put together a very capable team of lawyers and consultants. Biographies of all of the Commission Counsel are posted on our website.</p>
        <p>This Commission, like all commissions appointed under the <em>Public Inquiry Act, </em>S.B.C. 2007, c. 9, is independent of government. We serve the people of British Columbia.</p>
        <p>This means that the Commission must live up to certain standards in conducting its public hearings. One of the integral standards is that of fairness to those whose privacy interests, legal interests, or reputational interests may be affected by the proceedings. Another important standard for the Commission is thoroughness. The Commission must do its utmost to ensure that its subject matter is comprehensively and meaningfully covered. That entails hearing from a range of voices and points of view.</p>
        <p>One of the mechanisms of ensuring fairness and thoroughness is permitting certain parties to act as participants in the proceedings—if their interests may be affected by the findings of the Commission, if their participation would further the conduct of the Inquiry, and/or if their participation would contribute to the fairness of the Inquiry.</p>
        <p>Not all persons or organization representatives, who may be called as witnesses, are entitled to participant status. If a person believes that he or she has relevant evidence to give, they may be entitled to testify and they may be represented by counsel. It does not follow that having relevant evidence to give justifies a granting of participant status. The other conditions I have mentioned must be in play.</p>
        <p>This hearing is not adversarial. It is an attempt by all present to get at the root of the question of whether Messrs. Desmarais, Lightbody and Pinnock meet the criteria for status as participants, or whether their involvement is appropriately confined to be a witness or potential witness. I do not anticipate any need for extensive evidence or any cross-examination at this hearing. A simple exploration of the factual and statutory conditions at issue will lead to an appropriate resolution.</p>
        <p>As I understand it, Mr. Martland and Mr. McGowan have spoken with counsel for Messrs. Desmarais, Lightbody and Pinnock and have agreed upon a format for proceeding this morning. I will now ask one of them to set forth what format these proceedings will follow.</p>
