<p><a href="/files/2019-10-08-Application-Hearing-Transcript.pdf">Oral Hearing Participants Standing – Transcript from Oct 18, 2019</a></p>
<p>The Inquiry is planning to engage with members of the public in a number of ways, and people can provide information to the commission by emailing <a href="mailto:info@cullencommission.ca">info@cullencommission.ca</a>  There may be public meetings held this fall, to allow people to tell the Commissioner about their concerns with money laundering in the province. Information about those meetings and about how people can stay informed about our work will be available on this website, and will be updated regularly.</p>
<p>For individuals who believe they have relevant information or who want to testify at the Inquiry public hearings, we suggest they contact commission counsel, which they can do by emailing <a href="mailto:info@cullencommission.ca">info@cullencommission.ca</a> and making the request.</p>
<p>For individuals and organizations who seek formal standing as participants at the Inquiry’s hearings (similar to parties in a court case), the Commission has Rules for Standing that are available below. The Rules provide a due date of September 6, 2019, but the Commissioner has the discretion to extend that deadline, and anyone seeking to apply for participant status after that date is encouraged to apply in accordance with the Rules, and to seek an extension of time. Those applications will all be carefully considered and determined on their merits.</p>
